## Turbulent Fluxes, Planetary Boundary Layers, and Lidars

When you have a sunny, hot day without wind, you may see some gliders/sail planes out and about catching the thermals. In the atmospheric science world, these thermals produce what is known as an unstable planetary boundary layer. The solar radiation is heating up the ground, which heats the air right above it. This air is now warmer and less dense than the air above it and rises. We call it unstable, because less dense air is below more dense air, which nature doesn't jive with. As the newly heated air rises through the denser air, cooler air replaces resulting in a bunch of turbulent mixing. Imagine a pot of boiling water; the bubbles rising are like the thermals in the atmosphere, and the motion of the water is very turbulent.

This mixing in the atmosphere also mixes the aerosols (dust or pollution) or anything else held in suspension, such as water vapor. Since we humans produce a fair amount of pollution, a lot of it accumulates next to the ground until the thermals take it higher into the atmosphere. However, these thermals only go so far before they reach less dense air and/or cool down and just stop climbing. This is known as the height of the unstable planetary boundary layer. This means there is a limit to how far that pollution can easily mix skyward, making an apparent disconnect where the thermals stop, in terms of pollution density. Well, with lidars, you get a lot more backscatter (reflections) off aerosols than you do with clean air. Therefore, you can tell where the thermals stop by looking at them with a lidar. Depending on the temporal (time) resolution of the lidar, you can even see the individual thermals as they rise and fall, which is same as looking at the turbulent mixing and fluxes (vector per area) of the planetary boundary layer with the rest of the atmosphere.

Using a lidar for this purpose can help track air pollution and understand the optical properties of the atmosphere and is another tool in the trade of the atmospheric scientist.

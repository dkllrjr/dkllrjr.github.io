title: MPLNET Wavelet and Planetary Boundary Layer Detection
---

The Micro Pulse Lidar Network (MPLNET) is a network of low power lidars that take vertical profiles of the atmosphere through measuring the backscatter of a 532nm beam. The backscatter interacts with different molecules and aerosols, the latter of which behave as tracers in the atmospheric flow. This means we can measure things like the planetary boundary layer by looking at the levels of aerosol backscatter in the lidar profiles. Basically, what I'm trying to do is calculate the boundary layer height by applying a wavelet transformation to the lidar profiles. I think theirs a lot of information to be gained by doing so.

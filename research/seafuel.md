The Seafuel project serves the purpose of investigating the ability to extract carbon dioxide from the surface layer (and possibly deeper) of the ocean and turn it into fuel. Google X looked into [this](googlex) but decided that it wasn't cost effective to bring it to market. However, they did successfully make some methanol from collected carbon dioxide. The project is still in its infancy but we are making progress developing a prototype and where you could put it around the world.

## Research

### Alaska Space Grant Program Undergraduate Research Fellowship

Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks, _Fairbanks, Alaska, USA_  
Fall 2017 – Fall 2018  

- Using NASA MPLNET and Radiosonde data to determine the intraday variability of the high latitude atmospheric boundary layer
- Developing algorithms to determine atmospheric boundary layer structural parameters from Micro Pulse Laser Radars (Lidar)
- Compare and contrast collocated Lidar and Radiosonde retrievals of ABL parameters
- Produce statistical estimates of ABL parameters and compute diurnal and seasonal variations 
- Analysis of high latitude ABL with MPLNET, RAOBS, and GPSRO
 
### Master of Science Research Thesis

College of Engineering and Mines, University of Alaska, Fairbanks _Fairbanks, Alaska, USA_ and NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center, _Edwards Air Force Base, California, USA_  
Fall 2017 - Fall 2018  

- Using NASA Fiber Optic Sensing System (FOSS) and conventional strain gauge systems in high electromagnetic interference environments found in aviation
- Developed a load cell designed around the FOSS to measure thrust from an electric motor coupled with a 3-blade propeller to develop future electric propulsion systems
- Analyze and compare data retrieved using FOSS and conventional strain gauges
- Determined the effect of electromagnetic interference on the thrust loading measurements
- Determined the effect of mechanical interference/vibration with both systems in same application

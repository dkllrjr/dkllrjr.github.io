## About Me

I'm a frost-bitten Alaskan (no, we don't live in igloos, but I had a few classmates that mushed dogs) that focuses on research. I primarily study the polar atmosphere boundary layer, but I also have dabbled a fair amount into signal processing and data analysis. I'm mainly interested in fluid mechanics and its applications, such as in aerospace and geophysical fluids, but I also have interests in computation (quantum computing and programming) and optics. I enjoy learning and the pursuit of knowledge, as well as a pick up game of hockey here and there. See you in the lab or on the ice.

## Other Things About Me

I played hockey competitively growing up, peaking at Junior A Tier III in the AWHL before it was absorbed by the NA3HL. I've played in Southern California, Montana, Wyoming, and, of course, Alaska. I still play off an on when I can, be it intramurals at the college or pick-up with the beer league. I tend to travel with my gear just in case the situation arises.

Beyond hockey, I've trained in and taught Krav Maga, a self defense system designed for the Israeli Defense Force, for a little over 4 years. I've dabbled in both Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu a little as well; fun and useful skills to complement my Krav Maga training. I'm from Alaska (I was raised there, 2nd generation), so naturally I have a lot of experience with the outdoors. And the outdoors has a lot of experience with me too; I've taken a few nasty looks from a few unhappy critters here and there (had to pepper spray one, that was fun). I'm into to aerospace and aviation, when I get the funds and time I'd like to get into to flying and owning a small aircraft. Perhaps someday. Frankly, lately, I've been really getting into downhill skiing.

I really have quite a few interests, I've done research on the atmospheric boundary layer but I'm also interested in computation (particularly in quantum computing and other forms of computing), mathematics, and light and optics.

If you want to know more, or are interested in getting in touch, go ahead and send an email. I'll reply as soon as I can.

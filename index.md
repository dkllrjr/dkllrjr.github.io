title: My Name is Douglas Keller

Welcome to my piece of the internet. It's nothing grand but it gets me by. I'm a PhD student at the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique at École Polytechnique here in France. I'm from Alaska originally, but I decided to see what things were like across the pond. Turns out France and Alaska are quite different (who knew!), but the experience is very rewarding. I tend to experiment and try different things (check out [my research](research.html) and [my projects](projects.html)), but coding and fluid mechanics are almost always present. Anyways, welcome again and learn more about me by checking out [my blog](gopher.alaskanresearcher.org) (good luck getting there; it's not direct on purpose) and [the about me page](about.html).

Welcome to my piece of the internet. It's nothing grand but it gets me by. I'm a PhD student at Ã‰cole Polytechnique here in France. I'm actually really far away from my homeland, mother Alaska. Turns out France and Alaska are quite different (who knew!). I tend to experiment and try different things, but I code a lot and fluid mechanics are almost always present. I dabble in optics as well. Anyways, welcome again!

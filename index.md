Welcome to my piece of the internet. It's nothing grand but it gets me by. I'm a PhD student at the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique at École Polytechnique here in France. I'm actually really far away from my homeland, mother Alaska. Turns out France and Alaska are quite different (who knew!). I tend to experiment and try different things, but I code a lot and fluid mechanics are almost always present. I dabble in optics as well. Anyways, welcome again and learn more about me by checking out my blog, research, and projects!

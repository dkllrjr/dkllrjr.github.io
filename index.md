# Doug Keller

## TL;DR

I'm a frost-bitten Alaskan that focuses on research. I recently graduated from the University of Alaska Fairbanks with my Bachelors and Masters in Mechanical Engineering and now I'm on my way to Ã‰cole Polytechnique in France to do my PhD.

## "Grab a Chair"

I'm from Alaska (I was raised there, 2nd generation), so naturally I have a lot of experience with the outdoors. And the outdoors have a lot of experience with me too; I've taken a few nasty looks from a few unhappy critters here and there (had to pepper spray one, that was fun; did you know wolverines really don't like things approaching what they think is their food?). I've done a lot of fishing, in the interior and along the coast (fishing for salmon is pretty great, I highly recommend it; just be kind and leave enough fish in the river for everyone). The mountains in AK are amazing, especially the ones along the coast (I've hiked in all the major ranges of Alaska); definitely go check them out if you can. I'm into to aerospace and aviation; when I get the funds and time I'd like to get into to flying and owning a small aircraft. Perhaps someday I'll get that chance (a lot of people have planes in Alaska, it's pretty common).

I played hockey competitively growing up, peaking at Junior A Tier III in the AWHL before it was absorbed by the NA3HL (I don't keep up on that stuff, NA3HL may changed too). I've played in southern California, Montana, Wyoming, and, of course, Alaska. I still play off and on when I can, be it intramurals at the college or pick-up with the beer league. I tend to travel with my gear just in case the situation arises.

Beyond hockey, I've trained in and taught Krav Maga, a self defense system designed for the Israeli Defense Force, for a little over 4 years. I've dabbled in both Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu a little as well; fun and useful skills to complement my Krav Maga training. Muay thai is a real kick in the pants, literally and figuratively. Quick description: Muay thai is the fighting style where people kick through banana trees (I had a friend train muay thai in Thailand for a while. Everyone there knows it and can use it to some degree; kind of like hockey in Canada. In short: don't pick a fight there).

Frankly, lately, I've been really getting into downhill and backcountry skiing. I definitely have aspirations for skiing some of the major mountains in Alaska, Canada, and Europe. We'll see how that goes.

I really have quite a few interests, I've done research on the atmosphere as covered a little above (check out my [current research](research.html), and [my past stuff](aged_research.html)), but I'm also interested in electronics, computation (particularly in quantum computing and other forms of computing), mathematics, and optics (check out my [projects](projects.html) for my personal projects).

If you want to know more, or are interested in getting in touch, go ahead and send an email (email emblem at the bottom of the page, or twitter, but I don't check that as often; weird I know). I'll reply as soon as I can. I'm always interested in different and new opportunities.

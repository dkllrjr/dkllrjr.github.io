    # Doug Keller

    I'm a frost-bitten Alaskan that focuses on research. I recently graduated from the University of Alaska Fairbanks with my Bachelors and Masters in Mechanical Engineering and now I'm on my way to Ã‰cole Polytechnique in France to do my PhD.
    
    I really have quite a few interests, I've done research on the atmosphere as covered a little above (check out my [current research](research.html), and [my past stuff](aged_research.html)), but I'm also interested in electronics, computation (particularly in quantum computing and other forms of computing), mathematics, and optics (check out my [projects](projects.html) for my personal projects).
    
    If you want to know more, or are interested in getting in touch, go ahead and send an email (email emblem at the bottom of the page, or twitter, but I don't check that as often; weird I know). I'll reply as soon as I can. I'm always interested in different and new opportunities.

It all starts here. And what a start it is. I just rebuilt my website, so what you see before you is the new version. I like this version better. I'd show the last version but I'm lazy.

Anyways, howdy y'all! As you could see from my homepage, I'm a PhD student in France. I'm at the lab Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique, and my thesis is on the interaction of the Mistral and the Gulf of Lion; in particular, its influence on the deep convection that drives the thermohaline cycle. A few long words there but basically it helps the circulation of the Mediterranean Sea. Without it, some life in the sea doesn't bloom and the sea is worse off for it. The full effects of losing the deep convection isn't known, but what is known is it will go away eventually if the Earth keeps warming. Lets hope we don't find out.

Other than that, I'm writing from an apartment in Paris, in quarantine due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. We are "relaxing" quarantine tomorrow, and a lot of people are going back to work. We shall see how the international population handles closer contact again. I hope all goes well but the pandemic models supposedly show that we will just generate a second wave of infections. I guess we will see. To health. My life hasn't changed that much. I'm a salary employee technically and I can work from home without issue, so besides moving my office from the lab to home, it's the same. Stay safe everyone!

I plan to write more about science, engineering, maybe some philosophy, and possibly some politics here on this blog, so look out for that. Anyways, see you around!

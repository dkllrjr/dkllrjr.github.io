title: PyNondimensionalizer
---

My little python program to help find nondimensional numbers. Exciting, I know! It is actually nice if you want to simplify an analytical solution so that it doesn't depend on a scale. James Price has a nice essay that describes more in depth, but basically what I've done here is made a program that solves the nullspace of a dimensional matrix with the key variables of a given problem.

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I'm a frost-bitten Alaskan (no, we don't live in igloos, but I had a few classmates that mushed dogs) that focuses on research. I primarily study the polar atmosphere boundary layer, but I also have dabbled a fair amount into signal processing and data analysis. I'm mainly interested in fluid mechanics and its applications, such as in aerospace and geophysical fluids, but I also have interests in computation (quantum computing and programming) and optics. I enjoy learning and the pursuit of knowledge, as well as a pick up game of hockey here and there. See you in the lab or on the ice.</p>

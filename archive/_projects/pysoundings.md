I made a small python module that pulls atmospheric sounding data from the [University of Wyoming, College of Engineering, Department of Atmospheric Science's website](http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.html) into a [pandas.DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html).

## Raman Spectrum Lidar

Oct 2016 â€“ May 2017

Project descriptionA Raman backscattering based lidar that retrieve the different amounts of the different phases of water in the polar atmosphere.

Gained experience in optomechanical design for Lidar development. Developed simulation of Lidar signals to condition instrument design for 532 nm, N2, and H2O Raman vibrational bands. Implemented multichannel Lidar receiver

# Aged Research and Projects

Here lies my old research/projects. Enjoy! (These can be potentially resurrected, given proper resuscitation; email me: <dg.kllr.jr@gmail.com>)

## FOSS Load Cell

This project was performed for my Master's research. Electric motors are starting to find their way into aviation and NASA has been playing with them to determine their ability. The problem was when they were trying find out the thrust loads an electric motor can produce (with a prop), the load cells used were affected by the electromagnetic interference (EMI) thrown off by the motor. This resulted in NASA's testing not being able to produce the thrust data. This happened because the load cells on the market use resistance based strain gauges (the traditional type of strain gauge found in most strain sensing applications) and the signal in the strain gauges was muddied up by the EMI, or so the theory goes. Danny Eagan and I designed and built a load cell that features both fiber Bragg gratings (optical strain gauges) and resistance based strain gauges. The load cell was to be used for sensing thrust loadings off an electric motor with a flywheel or prop attached. The fiber Bragg gratings aren't affected by the EMI, so by having both sensors on the same device the effect of EMI can be determined.

Here's a picture of the machined thin-wall cylinder:

This is the video for the Fiber Optic Sensing System (FOSS) load cell Danny Eagan and I developed for my Master's research project (and also our Senior Project design for our Bachelor's):

This videos shows a little demo of the FOSS picking up the increased weight:

Here are a few runs during testing. Some with the flywheel and some with the prop.

## Raman Spectrum Lidar

A Raman backscattering based lidar that retrieve the different amounts of the different phases of water in the polar atmosphere.

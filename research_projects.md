# Research

Short summary of what I do.

Here is the research I'm currently working on.

This page still needs to be updated, and it probably will be after the AMS conference in January 2019.

## Superior Mirages

So when you have an atmosphere that has a warm air layer atop a cold air layer, you create a stable condition with the denser air rests below the less dense air. The denser air has a larger refractive index, so light bends toward it when travelling through. This can cause in extreme conditions, superior mirages, where light rays travelling to the observer (you or I) overlap each other. When they overlap, the original image of what you would see normally, is distorted, creating a mirage. It can result in some really interesting images. Here's a video that shows such a mirage.

Here's a cool video showing some miraging in the Alaska winter:

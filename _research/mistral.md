The Mistral wind is a cool, dry, strong wind that flows out through the Rhône Valley in the southern part of France into the Gulf of Lion. When it flows over the Mediterranean, it cools and evaporates the water near the surface. This does two things: it cools off the water, making it denser, and it converts more liquid water into gaseous water, leaving behind the salt, which again makes the surface water more dense. Now the surface water is denser than the water underneath and it drops, creating a convection cycle. Due to how the Mediterranean circulates, this convective cycling can aid the circulation and mix around the nutrients in the column of water with ecological consequences.

This is what I will be primarily focusing on for the next 3 years at École Polytechnique and LMD. My job is to model the Mistral's interaction with the Mediterranean and the resulting convective cycling.
